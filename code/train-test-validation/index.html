        <h2>The Importance of Data Splitting <br /></h2>

          >.<br /><br /><br /><br />
          In most supervised machine learning tasks, best practice recommends to
          split your data into three independent sets: a
          <span id="annotation1"><b>training set</b></span
          >, a <span id="annotation2"><b>testing set</b></span
          >, and a <span id="annotation3"><b>validation set</b></span
          >. <br /><br />

          To demo the reasons for splitting data in this manner, we will pretend
          that we have a dataset made of pets of the following two types:
          <br /><br />
          <span class="center"
            ><span class="b">Cats</span>:&nbsp;
            <img
              width="1.5rem"
              height="auto"
              class="inline-svg"
              src="./assets/noun_Cat_18061.svg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <span class="b">Dogs</span>:&nbsp;
            <img
              width="1.5rem"
              height="auto"

              src="./assets/noun_Dog_79225.svg"
          /></span>
          <br /><br />
          For each pet in the dataset we know only two features:
          <span class="b">weight</span> and <span class="b">fluffiness</span>.
          <br /><br />
          Our goal is to make use of the different data splits and identify a
          best model for classifying a given pet as either a cat or a dog, based
          on the available features.

            For each pet in our dataset, we have two features:
            <span class="bold">weight</span> and
            <span class="bold">fluffiness</span>. <br /><br />
            Our goal is to identify and evaluate suitable models for classifying
            a given pet as either a cat or a dog. We'll use

            Since our model learns from it, it is very important that the

            downstream

            To give our model as much information to learn from as possible, we

            data to the training set.

          <h2>Building Our Model</h2>
          <p>
            Our goal is to determine whether a given pet is a cat or a dog. This
            is a binary classification task, so we will use a simple but
            effective model appropriate for this task:

              ><span class="bold">logistic regression</span></a

            Given a particular combination of the available features (<span
              class="bold"
              >None</span
            >, <span class="bold">Weight</span>,

            <span class="bold">Weight</span> and
            <span class="bold">Fluffiness</span>), the logistic regression
            classifier will generate a decision boundary to partition the pets
            into either cats or dogs. Each pet will be classified based on its
            position relative to the decision boundary: one side for dogs, the
            other for cats. <br /><br />
            Select the feature set of your choice to visualize the corresponding
            logistic regression model's decision boundary. <br /><br /><b

          <h2>The Validation Set</h2>
          <p>
            For logistic regression, we can build four different classifiers
            &mdash; one for each choice of features to be included in the model:
            none
            <!-- <span class="tooltip-item"
              >[*]<span class="tooltiptext"> i.e. majority vote</span></span

            , just weight, just fluffiness, or both weight and fluffiness.
            <br /><br />
            <b>How should we decide which model to select?</b> <br /><br />
            We could compare the accuracy of each model on the training set, but
            doing so will result in a biased outcome &mdash; if we use the same
            exact dataset for both training and tuning, the model will overfit
            and will not generalize well beyond that dataset.<br /><br />
            <b>This is where the validation set comes in</b> &mdash;
            <span id="annotation8"
              >it acts as an independent, unbiased dataset for comparing the
              performance of different algorithm and hyperparameter choices

            >
            <br /><br />
            In our case, we are only looking at one algorithm (logistic
            regression), but we can view the number of considered features as a
            hyperparameter that we would like to tune<span class="tooltip-item"
              >[*]<span class="tooltiptext">
                For expository purposes, we won't worry about other choices for
                our logistic regression model, such as specific solvers or

          <h2>The Testing Set</h2>
          <p>
            So, assuming you did not go too crazy moving the pets around, our
            best model (according to the validation set) is the model that takes
            both features into account. <br /><br />
            Once we have used the validation set to determine the algorithm and
            parameter choices that we would like to use in production, the test
            set is used to approximate the models's true performance in the
            wild.
            <br /><br />Let's repeat that again:
            <span id="annotation9"
              >the test set is used as the final step in evaluating our model's
              performance on unseen data.</span
            >
            <br /><br />
            <b
              >We should never, under any circumstance, look at the test set's
              performance before selecting a model.</b
            >
            <br /><br />
            The role of model selection and parameter tuning is strictly for the
            validation set.
            <br /><br />
            Peeking at our test set performance ahead of time is a form of
            overfitting, and will likely lead to unreliable performance
            expectations in production. It should only be checked as the final
            form of evaluation, after the validation set has been used to
            identify the best model.

          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            You may have noticed that the test accuracy of the "just fluffiness"
            model was higher than that of the "both features" model, despite the
            validation set selecting the latter model as the best. This
            occurrence of the validation performance not exactly matching the
            test performance might happen, yet it is not a bad thing. Remember
            that the test performance is not a number to optimize over &mdash;
            it is a metric to assess future performance. It allows us to
            estimate, with confidence, that our model can distinguish between
            cats and dogs with 87.5% accuracy.

            <br /><br />
            <span class="bold">Key Takeaways</span>
            <br /><br />
            It is best practice in machine learning to split our data into the
            following three groups:

            <br /><br />
            <span id="annotation10"
              ><span class="bold">Training Set</span>:
              <span class="item-text">For training of the model.</span></span
            >
            <br /><br />
            <span id="annotation11">
              <span class="bold">Validation Set</span>:
              <span class="item-text"
                >For unbiased evaluation of the model.</span
              ></span
            ><br /><br />
            <span id="annotation12"
              ><span class="bold">Test Set</span>:
              <span class="item-text"
                >For final evaluation of the model.</span
              ></span
            >
            <br /><br />
            Adhering to this setup helps ensure that we have a realistic
            understanding of our model's performance, and that we (hopefully)
            built a model that generalizes well to unseen data.
