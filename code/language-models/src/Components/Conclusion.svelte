    While machine learning algorithms have the potential to revolutionize
    decision-making, we must be mindful of the biases they may perpetuate.
    Equality of Odds (EO) offers a promising approach to mitigating bias and
    promoting diversity in machine learning models. By promoting diverse
    outcomes, EO can help build fairer and more equitable machine learning
    systems in areas such as hiring, lending, and criminal justice. However, we
    must carefully consider the context and potential trade-offs between
    competing objectives when implementing any approach to bias mitigation.
