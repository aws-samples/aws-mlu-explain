This repository holds the code used for Amazon's [MLU-Explain](https://mlu-explain.github.io/) educational articles on machine learning. MLU-Explain exists to illustrate core machine learning concepts using visual essays in a fun, informative, and accessible manner.

This material exists as supplementary educational material for [Machine Learning University (MLU)](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/mlu/), which provides anybody, anywhere, at any time access to the same machine learning courses used to train Amazon’s own developers on machine learning.

## Precision & Recall

<img src="./assets/gifs/precision-recall.gif" alt="Precision & Recall Article Preview" width="400"/>

**Title**: [Precision & Recall](https://mlu-explain.github.io/precision-recall/)

**Summary**: When it comes to evaluating classification models, accuracy is often a poor metric. This article covers two common alternatives, Precision and Recall, as well as the F1-score and Confusion Matrices.

**Code**: [/code/precision-recall/](/code/precision-recall)

**Authors**: Jared Wilber

## Random Forest

<img src="./assets/gifs/random-forest.gif" alt="Random Forest Article Image" width="400"/>

**Title**: [Random Forest](https://mlu-explain.github.io/random-forest/)

**Summary**: Learn how the majority vote and well-placed randomness can extend the decision tree model to one of machine learning's most widely-used algorithms, the Random Forest.

**Code**: [/code/random-forest/](/code/random-forest)

**Authors**: Jenny Yeon, Jared Wilber

## Decision Trees

<img src="./assets/gifs/decision-tree.gif" alt="Decision Trees Article Image" width="400"/>

**Title**: [Decision Trees](https://mlu-explain.github.io/decision-tree/)

**Summary**: Explore one of machine learning's most popular supervised algorithms: the Decision Tree. Learn how the tree makes its splits, the concepts of Entropy and Information Gain, and why going too deep is problematic.

**Code**: [/code/decision-tree/](/code/decision-tree)

**Authors**: Jared Wilber, Lucía Santamaría

## Bias Variance Tradeoff

<img src="./assets/gifs/mlu-explain_biasvariance.gif" alt="Bias Variance Tradeoff Article Image" width="400"/>

**Title**: [The Bias Variance Tradeoff](https://mlu-explain.github.io/bias-variance/)

**Summary**: Understand the tradeoff between under- and over-fitting models, how it relates to bias and variance, and explore interactive examples related to LOESS and KNN.

**Code**: [/code/bias-variance/](/code/bias-variance)

**Authors**: Jared Wilber, Brent Werness

## Double Descent: A Visual Introduction

<img src="./assets/gifs/double-descent1.gif" alt="Double Descent Article Image" width="400"/>

**Title**: [Double Descent](https://mlu-explain.github.io/double-descent/)

**Summary**: Meet the double descent phenomenon in modern machine learning: what it is, how it relates to the bias-variance tradeoff, the importance of the interpolation regime, and a theory of what lies behind.

**Code**: [/code/double-descent/](/code/double-descent)

**Authors**: Jared Wilber, Brent Werness

## Double Descent 2: A Mathematical Explanation

<img src="./assets/gifs/double-descent2.gif" alt="Double Descent 2 Article Image" width="400"/>

**Title**: [Double Descent 2](https://mlu-explain.github.io/double-descent2/)

**Summary**: Deepen your understanding of the double descent phenomenon. The article builds on the cubic spline example introduced in Double Descent 1, describing in mathematical detail what is happening.
